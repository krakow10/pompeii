### Imposed restrictions
- (At least) Vulkan API version 1.3 must be used. This version greatly reduced the extension/feature fragmentation in the ecosystem and makes the engine both concise and portable.
- The chosen physical device must support the feature `VkPhysicalDeviceSynchronization2Features`. This feature is common in modern hardware and allows for better synchronization primitives and API.
